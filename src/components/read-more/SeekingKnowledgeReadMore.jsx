          <p>
            In Islam, the pursuit of knowledge stands as a fundamental duty and
            an honored endeavor for every Muslim. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be
            upon him) unequivocally stated,{" "}
            <strong>"Seeking knowledge is a duty upon every Muslim."</strong>{" "}
            This Hadith underscores the obligatory nature of acquiring
            knowledge, encompassing both religious understanding and worldly
            education.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Quran echoes this sentiment, urging believers to seek
            enlightenment through learning. In Surah Taha, verse 114, it is
            mentioned,{" "}
            <strong>"And say: My Lord, increase me in knowledge."</strong> This
            divine encouragement emphasizes the significance of seeking
            knowledge and beseeching God for its augmentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout Islamic history, the pursuit of knowledge has been
            revered and cultivated. Scholars and luminaries of Islam established
            centers of learning that transcended religious studies, encompassing
            a broad spectrum of disciplines. These institutions fostered an
            environment conducive to intellectual exploration, advancing
            knowledge in fields such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine,
            philosophy, and beyond.
