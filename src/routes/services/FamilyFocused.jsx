            Islam begins at home. Our family-oriented programs are designed to
            support parents and children together, helping households grow
            spiritually, emotionally, and intellectually through shared Islamic
            learning.

            Parenting with Purpose
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Raising righteous children in today’s complex world can be
            overwhelming. Our "Parenting with Purpose" workshops equip parents
            with tools and wisdom derived from the Qur’an and Sunnah. Topics
            include nurturing self-discipline through love, teaching adab
            (manners) through example, and establishing prophetic routines at
            home.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            We also explore how to address digital challenges, emotional
            outbursts, and peer influence while maintaining strong Islamic
            values. With live Q&A sessions, group support, and resources for
            different age groups, this program empowers you to raise confident
            Muslim children ready to face modern-day tests with a firm spiritual
            foundation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Our certified counselors and Islamic educators are passionate about
            bridging the gap between tradition and today’s parenting struggles,
            ensuring that every home becomes a place of peace, growth, and
            barakah.

            Family Qur’an & Story Sessions
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Turn your family time into spiritually uplifting moments. Our weekly
            online sessions invite parents and children to explore the Qur’an
            together through age-appropriate tafsir, reflections on the stories
            of the Prophets, and shared journaling activities that promote
            bonding and mindfulness.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Each session is designed to foster conversation and reflection, not
            just listening. Children love the engaging questions, while parents
            gain insights into how to talk about tough topics with clarity and
            compassion rooted in the Deen.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            These sessions serve as an anchor in busy family lives — a time to
            slow down, connect, and grow together as one unit in the light of
            the Qur’an.
